Calculator UI
A simple calculator UI implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Description
The Calculator UI project provides a basic calculator user interface that allows users to perform mathematical calculations in a user-friendly way. With an intuitive design and familiar button layout, users can easily input numbers and mathematical operators to perform arithmetic operations.

The calculator UI features a text input field that displays the entered values and results. Users can click on the number buttons (0-9) to input numeric values, and the operators buttons (+, -, *, /) to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The decimal point button (.) enables the input of decimal numbers. The "C" button clears the input field, allowing users to start fresh. Finally, the "=" button evaluates the expression entered in the input field and displays the result.

The project aims to provide a simple yet functional calculator interface that can be easily integrated into other web applications or used as a standalone tool. The clean and responsive design ensures that the calculator UI is accessible on various devices and screen sizes.
